علشان الشبكة تشتغل وتسمح بالتواصل بين الأجهزة، في ٣ عناصر أساسية بيكملوا بعض:
- **MAC Address**
- **IP Address**
- **Port**

التلاتة دول مع بعض بيضمنوا إن البيانات تتنقل من جهاز للتاني سواء جوا الشبكة المحلية أو عبر الإنترنت، وده بيخلي التواصل بين الأجهزة سلس ومظبوط.

> For a network to function and facilitate comunication properly, there are three crucial components: MAC addresses, IP addresses, and ports. Together, these elements ensure that data is correctly sent and received between devices across both local and global networks, forming the backbone of seamless network communication.

## 🆔 MAC Addresses

### 🎯 يعني إيه MAC Address؟

الـ MAC Address هو رقم فريد بيتخصص لكل كرت شبكة (NIC) في الجهاز، وده اللي بيخلي الجهاز يتعرف جوه الشبكة المحلية.  
الـ MAC شغال على الطبقة التانية (Data Link Layer) من نموذج OSI، وطوله 48 بت، وبيظهر عادة في شكل 6 أزواج من أرقام هيكس (Hexadecimal) متفصلين بـ `:` أو `-`.  
أول 24 بت منهم بيمثّلوا اسم الشركة المصنعة، والباقي بيبقى مميز للجهاز نفسه، علشان كده العنوان بيبقى فريد على مستوى العالم.

> A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface card (NIC) of a device, allowing it to be recognized on a local network. Operating at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, the MAC address is crucial for communication within a local network segment, ensuring that data reaches the correct physical device. Each MAC address is 48 bits long and is typically represented in hexadecimal format, appearing as six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens—**for example, 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.** The uniqueness of a MAC address comes from its structure: the first 24 bits represent the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned to the manufacturer, while the remaining 24 bits are specific to the individual device. This design ensures that every MAC address is globally unique, allowing devices worldwide to communicate without address conflicts.

### 🛠 إزاي MAC Addresses بتتستخدم في الشبكة؟

الـ MAC Address مهم جدًا جوا الشبكة المحلية (LAN)، علشان هو اللي بيخلّي السويتش يوصّل الفريم (البيانات) للجهاز الصح.

لما جهاز يبعَت بيانات، بيضيف عنوان MAC بتاع الجهاز التاني، والسويتش يقرأ العنوان ده ويوجه البيانات للبورت الصح.  
وبييجي دور بروتوكول اسمه ARP علشان يربط بين عنوان IP وعنوان MAC جوه نفس الشبكة.

تخيل عندك جهازين على نفس الشبكة:  
- جهاز A بـ IP `192.168.1.2` و MAC `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`  
- جهاز B بـ IP `192.168.1.5` و MAC `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F`

جهاز A لما يحب يبعَت بيانات لـ B، بيستخدم ARP علشان يعرف MAC الخاص بـ B، وبعد كده يبعت الفريم للسويتش بالعناوين الصح.

> MAC addresses are fundamental for local communication within a local area network (LAN), as they are used to deliver data frames to the correct physical device. When a device sends data, it encapsulates the information in a frame containing the destination MAC address; network switches then use this address to forward the frame to the appropriate port. Additionally, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) plays a crucial role by mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses, allowing devices to find the MAC address associated with a known IP address within the same network. This mapping is bridging the gap between logical IP addressing and physical hardware addressing within the LAN.

> Imagine two computers, Computer A (with an IP address of 192.168.1.2 - which we will discuss shortly) and Computer B (192.168.1.5), connected to the same network switch. Computer A has the MAC address 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E, while Computer B's MAC address is 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F. When Computer A wants to send data to Computer B, it first uses the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to discover Computer B's MAC address associated with its IP address. After obtaining this information, Computer A sends a data frame with the destination MAC address set to 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F. The switch receives this frame and forwards it to the specific port where Computer B is connected, ensuring that the data reaches the correct device. This is illustrated in the following diagram.

## 🌐 IP Addresses

### 🎯 يعني إيه IP Address؟

الـ IP Address هو رقم بيتخصص لكل جهاز متوصل بشبكة وبيستخدم بروتوكول الإنترنت علشان التواصل.  
وبيشتغل على الطبقة التالتة (Network Layer) من نموذج OSI.  

في نوعين:
- **IPv4**
بيكون 32 بت وبيظهر بالشكل ده مثلًا: `192.168.1.1`
- **IPv6**
بيكون 128 بت، معمول علشان نعوّض نقص عناوين IPv4، وبيظهر بالشكل ده: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

> An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that utilizes the Internet Protocol for communication. Functioning at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model, IP addresses enable devices to locate and communicate with each other across various networks. There are two versions of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses consist of a 32-bit address space, typically formatted as four decimal numbers separated by dots, such as 192.168.1.1. In contrast, IPv6 addresses, which were developed to address the depletion of IPv4 addresses, have a 128-bit address space and are formatted in eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, an example being 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.

### 🛠 إزاي IP Addresses بتشتغل؟

الراوترات بتستخدم الـ IP علشان تعرف توصل الباكت للطريق الصح.  
بعكس MAC اللي ثابت، الـ IP ممكن يتغيّر حسب الشبكة اللي انت فيها.

> Routers use IP addresses to determine the optimal path for data to reach its intended destination across interconnected networks. Unlike MAC addresses, which are permanently tied to the device's network interface card, IP addresses are more flexible; they can change and are assigned based on the network topology and policies. A communication example between two devices on the same network can be similarly illustrated as shown previously in the MAC Address subsection.

## 🔢 Ports

### 🎯 يعني إيه Port؟

البورت هو رقم بيتخصص لكل خدمة أو برنامج شغّال على الشبكة، وبيشتغل على الطبقة الرابعة (Transport Layer) باستخدام بروتوكولات زي TCP وUDP.  
البورت بيساعد إنك تشغّل كذا خدمة على نفس الجهاز من غير تضارب.

مثال:  
- لو بتفتح موقع عادي، المتصفح بيتصل بالسيرفر على بورت 80 (HTTP)  
- لو الموقع آمن، بيتصل على بورت 443 (HTTPS)

> A port is a number assigned to specific processes or services on a network to help computers sort and direct network traffic correctly. It functions at the Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model and works with protocols such as TCP and UDP. Ports facilitate the simultaneous operation of multiple network services on a single IP address by differentiating traffic intended for different applications.

> When a client application initiates a connection, it specifies the destination port number corresponding to the desired service. Client applications are those who request data or services, while server applications respond to those requests and provide the data or services. The operating system then directs the incoming traffic to the correct application based on this port number. Consider a simple example where a user accesses a website: the user’s browser initiates a connection to the server's IP address on port 80, which is designated for HTTP. The server, listening on this port, responds to the request. If the user needs to access a secure site, the browser instead connects to port 443, the standard for HTTPS, ensuring secure communication. Port numbers range from 0 to 65535, and it is divided into three main categories, each serving a specific function.

### 🧩 أنواع البورتات

#### ✅ Well-Known Ports (0-1023)

دي بورتات محجوزة للخدمات المعروفة، زي:
- HTTP → بورت 80
- HTTPS → بورت 443
- FTP → بورتات 20 و 21

> Well-known ports, numbered from 0 to 1023, are reserved for common and universally recognized services and protocols, as standardized and managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For instance, HTTP, which is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, uses port 80, although browsers typically do not display this port number to simplify user experience. Similarly, HTTPS uses port 443 for secure communications over networks, and this port is also generally not displayed by browsers. Another example is FTP, which facilitates file transfers between clients and servers, using ports 20 and 21.

#### 📝 Registered Ports (1024-49151)

البورتات دي بتتسجل رسميًا للخدمات اللي بتقدّمها شركات برمجيات. زي:
- Microsoft SQL Server → بورت 1433

> Registered ports, which range from 1024 to 49151, are not as strictly regulated as well-known ports but are still registered and assigned to specific services by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These ports are commonly used for external services that users might install on a device. For instance, many database services, such as Microsoft SQL Server, use port 1433. Software companies frequently register a port for their applications to ensure that their software consistently uses the same port on any system. This registration helps in managing network traffic and preventing port conflicts across different applications.

#### 🔁 Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535)

البورتات دي بيستخدمها الجهاز بشكل مؤقت أثناء الجلسة (زي لما تدخل على موقع)، وبتتقفل بعد ما الجلسة تخلص.

> Dynamic or private ports, also known as ephemeral ports, range from 49152 to 65535 and are typically used by client applications to send and receive data from servers, such as when a web browser connects to a server on the internet. These ports are called dynamic because they are not fixed; rather, they can be randomly selected by the client's operating system as needed for each session. Generally used for temporary communication sessions, these ports are closed once the interaction ends. Additionally, dynamic ports can be assigned to custom server applications, often those handling short-term connections.

## 🌍 مثال عملي: لما تفتح موقع من المتصفح

### 1. DNS Lookup  
الجهاز بيروح يجيب الـ IP الخاص بالدومين (زي: `example.com → 93.184.216.34`)

### 2. Data Encapsulation  
- المتصفح بيبعت طلب HTTP  
- بيتغلف بـ TCP ويتحدد البورت (80 أو 443 علي حسب البورت HTTP or HTTPS)  
- الباكت بيكون فيها عنوان الـ IP  
- الجهاز بيستخدم ARP يجيب MAC الراوتر

### 3. Data Transmission  
- الفريم بيتبعت لـ MAC بتاع الراوتر  
- الراوتر يوجّه الباكت للـ IP المطلوب  
- راوترات تانية توصل الباكت للسيرفر

### 4. Server Processing  
- السيرفر يستقبل الباكت  
- يوجّهها للتطبيق اللي شغال على البورت المطلوب  
- يعالج الطلب ويبعت الرد

### 5. Response Transmission  
- السيرفر يرد على البورت المؤقت اللي اختاره الجهاز  
- الرد يرجع بنفس الطريق لحد ما يوصل للمتصفح

> The following example represents the steps taken for a web request to reach the correct destination and return the information we seek.  
> 1. DNS Lookup  
> Our computer resolves the domain name to an IP address (e.g., 93.184.216.34 for example.com).  
> 
> 2. Data Encapsulation

> The request is encapsulated with TCP, specifying the destination port 80 or 443.  
> The packet includes the destination IP address 93.184.216.34.  
> On the local network, our computer uses ARP to find the MAC address of the default gateway (router).  
> 
> 3. Data Transmission  
> The data frame is sent to the router's MAC address.  
> The router forwards the packet toward the destination IP address.  
> Intermediate routers continue forwarding the packet based on the IP address.  
> 4. Server Processing  
> The server receives the packet and directs it to the application listening on port 80.  
> The server processes the HTTP request and sends back a response following the same path in reverse.  
> 
> 5. Response Transmission  
> The server sends the response back to the client’s temporary port, which was randomly selected by the client’s operating system at the start of the session.  
> The response follows the reverse path back through the network, being directed from router to router based on the source IP address and port information until it reaches the client.
