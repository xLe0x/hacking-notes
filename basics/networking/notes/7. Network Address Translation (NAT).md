## يعني إيه NAT؟

الإنترنت بيشتغل باستخدام عناوين رقمية اسمها IP addresses، والعناوين دي بتحدد كل جهاز على الشبكة. بس المشكلة إن نظام IPv4 عدد العناوين فيه محدود (حوالي 4.3 مليار عنوان)، وده مش كفاية بسبب التوسع الكبير في عدد الأجهزة المتصلة بالنت. هنا بييجي دور **NAT**، واللي فكرته ببساطة إنها بتسمح لأكتر من جهاز داخل شبكة خاصة إنهم يشاركوا نفس العنوان العام (Public IP). كده بنحافظ على عدد العناوين العامة وكمان بنضيف طبقة أمان بسيطة على الشبكة الداخلية.

> ### Network Address Translation (NAT)
> 
> The Internet relies on a system of numerical addresses, known as IP addresses, to route data from one device to another. The original addressing scheme, IPv4, offers a finite number of IP addresses (approximately 4.3 billion). Although this might sound like a lot, the explosive growth of the internet has meant these addresses are in short supply. One solution to this insufficiency issue is Network Address Translation (NAT). The idea is that NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. This not only helps conserve the limited pool of public IP addresses but also adds a layer of security to the internal network.

## الفرق بين Public IP و Private IP

**Public IP** هو العنوان اللي بيديهولك مزود الخدمة (ISP) علشان جهازك يقدر يتوصل بأي جهاز تاني على الإنترنت. العناوين دي فريدة، يعني مينفعش يتكرر عنوانين.

**Private IP** بقى هو اللي بيشتغل داخل الشبكات الصغيرة زي البيوت أو الشركات. العناوين دي مش بتظهر على الإنترنت ومينفعش توصل بيها لجهاز على النت مباشرة. العناوين دي محجوزة في الـ RFC 1918 وبتشتغل جوا الشبكة الداخلية بس.

ولما بنستخدم NAT، الأجهزة اللي على الشبكة الداخلية بتستخدم Private IPs، ولما تطلب حاجة من النت، الراوتر بيغير العنوان لـ Public IP بتاعه، وبالتالي كل الأجهزة تقدر تطلع على النت باستخدام عنوان واحد بس.

> ### Private vs. Public IP Addresses
>
> Public IP addresses are globally unique identifiers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Devices equipped with these IP addresses can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet, allowing them to communicate across the global network. For example, the IP address 8.8.8.8 is used for Google's DNS server, and 142.251.46.174 identifies one of Google’s web servers. These addresses ensure that devices can uniquely identify and reach each other over the internet.
>
> Private IP addresses are designated for use within local networks such as homes, schools, and offices. These addresses are not routable on the global internet, meaning packets sent to these addresses are not forwarded by internet backbone routers. Defined by RFC 1918, common IPv4 private address ranges include 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. This setup ensures that these private networks operate independently of the internet while facilitating internal communication and device connectivity.
>
> Private IP addresses contribute to conserving public IP addresses. Using Network Address Translation (NAT), a local network can utilize private IP addresses while sharing a single public IP address, reducing the number of public IPs needed. This setup makes devices accessible from the internet without using multiple public addresses. Additionally, private IPs help secure the network by isolating internal devices from direct exposure to the internet, protecting them from potential external threats.

## إيه هو NAT بالظبط؟

NAT هي عملية بيعملها الراوتر أو أي جهاز مشابه، بتعدل عنوان الـ IP اللي طالع أو داخل في الباكيت وهي ماشية في الشبكة. وده الهدف منه إنه يبدل العنوان الخاص بتاع الجهاز اللي جوا الشبكة بعنوان عام يقدر يتشاف على الإنترنت.

> ### What is NAT?
>
> Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process carried out by a router or a similar device that modifies the source or destination IP address in the headers of IP packets as they pass through. This modification is used to translate the private IP addresses of devices within a local network to a single public IP address that is assigned to the router.

## NAT بيشتغل إزاي؟

تخيل شبكة بيت فيها كذا جهاز: لابتوب، موبايل، كونسول ألعاب. كل جهاز واخد Private IP (زي 192.168.1.10 مثلاً). الراوتر عنده وجهتين: واحدة للـ LAN (يعني الشبكة الداخلية)، وواحدة للـ WAN (يعني الإنترنت).

لما اللابتوب يطلب يدخل على موقع زي Google، الراوتر بياخد الباكيت اللي جاية من اللابتوب، يغير الـ IP بتاعه من الخاص (192.168.1.10) للعامة بتاع الراوتر (203.0.113.50)، ويبعتها للنت. لما السيرفر يرد، الراوتر يعرف إن الرد ده رايح للابتوب، فيرجع يعدل العنوان ويوصل الباكيت للابتوب.

> ### How NAT Works
>
> Consider a home network with several devices, such as a laptop, a smartphone, and a gaming console, each assigned a unique private IP address: the laptop at 192.168.1.10, the smartphone at 192.168.1.11, and the gaming console at 192.168.1.12. The home router managing this network has two critical interfaces. The LAN (Local Area Network) interface connects to the private network with an IP address of 192.168.1.1, while the WAN (Wide Area Network) interface, connected to the ISP’s network, carries a public IP address, 203.0.113.50.
>
> The process of NAT translation begins when a device, say the laptop, sends a request to visit a website like www.google.com. This request packet, originating with the private IP of 192.168.1.10, is sent to the router. Here, the NAT function of the router modifies the source IP in the packet header from the private IP to the public IP of the router, 203.0.113.50. This packet then travels across the internet to reach the intended web server. Upon receiving the packet, the web server sends a response back to the router's public IP. As the response arrives, the router's NAT table, which keeps track of IP mappings, identifies that 203.0.113.50:4444 corresponds to the laptop at 192.168.1.10:5555 (ports 4444 and 5555 are dynamic). The router then translates the public IP back to the laptop’s private IP and forwards the internal response to the laptop, completing the communication cycle.

## 🔌 رسم توضيحي للشبكة

تخيل شبكة فيها: كمبيوتر، طابعة، موبايل، ولابتوب، كلهم واخدين Private IPs من 192.168.1.10 لـ 192.168.1.13، وكلهم متوصلين براوتر/NAT بياخد Public IP 203.0.113.50، والراوتر ده متوصل بسيرفر بعيد عنده Public IP 503.0.135.60. NAT هنا بيغير العناوين في الباكيتات حسب ما تمشي من وإلى الإنترنت.

> ### Network diagram: LAN with PC, printer, smartphone, and laptop (private IPs 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.13) connected to a router/NAT with public IP 203.0.113.50, linked to a remote server with public IP 503.0.135.60. NAT modifies host and destination IPs.

## أنواع NAT

في أكتر من نوع لـ NAT وكل نوع ليه استخدام معين:

| النوع | الوصف |
|------|-------|
| Static NAT | ربط واحد لواحد بين IP خاص وIP عام. |
| Dynamic NAT | بيخصص IP عام من مجموعة موجودة على حسب الحاجة. |
| PAT (Port Address Translation) | أو NAT Overload، وده الأكتر استخدامًا، بيسمح لأكتر من جهاز يستخدموا نفس الـ IP العام لكن بيميز كل اتصال برقم بورت مختلف. |

> ### Types of NAT
>
> To better understand Network Address Translation (NAT), It's helpful to know that there are several types of Network Address Translation (NAT), each designed for specific networking needs. Below are the different types of NAT.
>
> Type 	Description
> Static NAT 	Involves a one-to-one mapping, where each private IP address corresponds directly to a public IP address.
> Dynamic NAT 	Assigns a public IP from a pool of available addresses to a private IP as needed, based on network demand.
> Port Address Translation (PAT) 	Also known as NAT Overload, is the most common form of NAT in home networks. Multiple private IP addresses share a single public IP address, differentiating connections by using unique port numbers. This method is widely used in home and small office networks, allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address for internet access.

## ✅ مميزات وعيوب NAT

### المميزات:
- بيوفر في عدد عناوين IPv4 اللي هي قليلة.
- بيضيف طبقة حماية للشبكة الداخلية.
- بيديك حرية أكبر في توزيع الـ IPs جوه الشبكة.

### العيوب:
- تشغيل خدمات زي استضافة سيرفر محتاجة إعدادات زيادة (زي Port Forwarding).
- بعض البروتوكولات اللي محتاجة اتصال مباشر ممكن متشتغلش كويس مع NAT.
- ممكن يعقد شوية عمليات الـ Debug أو حل مشاكل الاتصال.

> ### Benefits and Trade-Offs
>
> Network Address Translation (NAT) offers a number of benefits and presents some trade-offs as well.
>
> Benefits
