الـ **TCP/IP Model** هو نسخة مبسطة وواقعية من OSI Model، وهو اللي بيستخدم فعلًا في الإنترنت وكل الشبكات الحديثة. بيتكون من 4 طبقات بس بدل 7.

## 🧱 1. Link Layer (طبقة الربط)

دي الطبقة اللي بتتعامل مع الأجهزة والتوصيلات الفيزيائية زى الكابلات وكروت الشبكة.  
بتشمل تقنيات زي Ethernet (للاتصال السلكي) و Wi-Fi (للاتصال اللاسلكي).  
**المكافئ في OSI:** بتغطي الـ Physical + Data Link Layer.

🧰 **أمثلة:**
- كابل الإنترنت
- كارت الشبكة (NIC)
- الـ MAC Address

This layer is responsible for handling the physical aspects of network hardware and media. It includes technologies such as Ethernet for wired connections and Wi-Fi for wireless connections. The Link Layer corresponds to the Physical and Data Link Layers of the OSI model, covering everything from the physical connection to data framing.

## 🌐 2. Internet Layer (طبقة الإنترنت)

المسؤولة عن العنونة المنطقية وتوصيل الداتا بين الشبكات المختلفة عن طريق الراوترات.  
البروتوكولات هنا بتحدد الطريق اللي هتمشي فيه الداتا.

🔌 **البروتوكولات المهمة:**
- الـ IP (Internet Protocol)
- الـ ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

**المكافئة لـ Network Layer في الـ OSI**

The `Internet Layer` manages the logical addressing of devices and the routing of packets across networks. Protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) operate at this layer, ensuring that data reaches its intended destination by determining logical paths for packet transmission. This layer corresponds to the Network Layer in the OSI model.

## 🔄 3. Transport Layer (طبقة النقل)

دي اللي بتضمن توصيل الداتا من جهاز لجهاز بشكل سليم.  

فيها نوعين من البروتوكولات:

- **TCP:** توصيل مضمون وفي ترتيب مضبوط.
- **UDP:** توصيل سريع بس من غير تأكيد.

**المكافئة لـ Transport Layer في الـ OSI**

At the `Transport Layer`, the TCP/IP model provides end-to-end communication services that are essential for the functioning of the internet. This includes the use of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable communication and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for faster, connectionless services. This layer ensures that data packets are delivered in a sequential and error-free manner, corresponding to the Transport Layer of the OSI model.

---

## 🌍 4. Application Layer (طبقة التطبيقات)

أعلى طبقة، ودي اللي بتتعامل مع البرامج اللي بنستخدمها زى المتصفح، برامج الإيميل، إلخ.  
هي اللي بتستخدم بروتوكولات الإنترنت بشكل مباشر.

📡 **أشهر البروتوكولات:**
- HTTP
- FTP
- SMTP
- DNS

**المكافئ في OSI:** Application + Presentation + Session Layers

The `Application Layer` of the TCP/IP model contains protocols that offer specific data communication services to applications. Protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) enable functionalities like web browsing, file transfers, and email services. This layer corresponds to the top three layers of the OSI model (Session, Presentation, and Application), providing interfaces and protocols necessary for data exchange between systems.

## 🔁 مقارنة سريعة مع OSI Model:

| OSI Model    | TCP/IP Model |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 7 طبقات      | 4 طبقات      |
| Physical     | Link         |
| Data Link    | Link         |
| Network      | Internet     |
| Transport    | Transport    |
| Session      | Application  |
| Presentation | Application  |
| Application  | Application  |

The TCP/IP model simplifies the complex structure of the OSI model by combining certain layers for practical implementation. Specifically designed around the protocols used on the internet, the TCP/IP model is more application-oriented, focusing on the needs of real-world network communication. This design makes it more effective for internet-based data exchange, meeting modern technological needs.

## 🌐 مثال: إزاي بندخل على موقع إنترنت؟

1. **Application Layer:** المتصفح بيبعت طلب بـ HTTP.
2. **Transport Layer:** TCP بيكسر الطلب لحزم ويراقب التوصيل.
3. **Internet Layer:** IP بيختار الطريق للـ Server.
4. **Link Layer:** الداتا بتتبعت فعليًا على الكابل أو Wi-Fi.

When accessing a website, several layers of the TCP/IP model work together to facilitate the process. At the Application Layer, your browser utilizes HTTP to request the webpage. This request then moves to the Transport Layer, where TCP ensures the data is transferred reliably. The Internet Layer comes into play next, with IP taking charge of routing the data packets from our device to the web server. Finally, at the Network Interface Layer, the data is physically transmitted over the network, completing the connection that allows us to view the website.

## 📜 البروتوكولات المشهورة:

| البروتوكول | بيعمل إيه؟              | الطبقة      |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| HTTP       | تصفح مواقع              | Application |
| FTP        | رفع/تحميل ملفات         | Application |
| SMTP       | إرسال الإيميلات         | Application |

|**Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)`|Primarily used for transferring web pages. It operates at the Application Layer, allowing browsers and servers to communicate in the delivery of web content.|
|`FTP (File Transfer Protocol)`|Facilitates the transfer of files between systems, also functioning at the Application Layer. It provides a way for users to upload or download files to and from servers.|
|`SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)`|Handles the transmission of email. Operating at the Application Layer, it is responsible for sending messages from one server to another, ensuring they reach their intended recipients.|
|`TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)`|Ensures reliable data transmission through error checking and recovery, operating at the Transport Layer. It establishes a connection between sender and receiver to guarantee the delivery of data in the correct order.|
|`UDP (User Datagram Protocol)`|Allows for fast, connectionless communication, which operates without error recovery. This makes it ideal for applications that require speed over reliability, such as streaming services. UDP operates at the Transport Layer.|
|`IP (Internet Protocol)`|Crucial for routing packets across network boundaries, functioning at the Internet Layer. It handles the addressing and routing of packets to ensure they travel from the source to the destination across diverse networks.|

# Transmission

عملية النقل في الشبكات تعني إرسال بيانات عبر بيئة (سلكية أو لاسلكية) من جهاز لأخر

`Transmission` in networking refers to the process of sending data signals over a medium from one device to another. To further understand this concept, let’s examine the different types of transmission, the modes in which these transmissions can occur, and the media that carry the signals.

## 🔊 أنواع نقل البيانات (Transmission Types):

- **Analog:** زي الراديو، إشارة مستمرة.
- **Digital:** زي الكمبيوتر، إشارات 0 و 1.

Transmission in networking can be categorized into two main types: `analog` and `digital`. Analog transmission uses continuous signals to represent information, commonly seen in traditional radio broadcasts. In contrast, digital transmission employs discrete signals (bits) to encode data, which is typical in modern communication technologies like computer networks and digital telephony.

## 🔁 أوضاع النقل (Transmission Modes):

- **Simplex:** اتجاه واحد (مثال: الكيبورد).
- **Half Duplex:** اتجاهين بس واحد في المرة (مثال: Walkie Talkie).
- **Full Duplex:** الاتجاهين في نفس الوقت (مثال: مكالمة تليفون).

Transmission modes define how data is sent between two devices. `Simplex` mode allows one-way communication only, such as from a keyboard to a computer, where signals travel in a single direction. `Half-duplex` mode permits two-way communication but not simultaneously; examples include walkie-talkies where users must take turns speaking. `Full-duplex` mode, used in telephone calls, supports two-way communication simultaneously, allowing both parties to speak and listen at the same time.

## 🧵 وسائط النقل (Transmission Media):

- **سلكية:**
  - Twisted Pair (كابلات الإنترنت)
  - Coaxial (تلفزيون)
  - Fiber Optic (سرعة عالية جدًا)

- **لاسلكية:**
  - Wi-Fi (موجات راديو)
  - Microwave (أقمار صناعية)
  - Infrared (ريموت كنترول)

The physical means by which data is transmitted in a network is known as transmission media, which can be wired or wireless. Wired media includes `twisted pair` cables, commonly used in Ethernet networks and local area network (LAN) connections; `coaxial` cables, used for cable TV and early Ethernet; and `fiber optic` cables, which transmit data as light pulses and are essential for high-speed internet backbones. Wireless media, on the other hand, encompasses `radio waves` for Wi-Fi and cellular networks, `microwaves` for satellite communications, and `infrared` technology used for short-range communications like remote controls. Each type of media has its specific use cases depending on the requirements of the network environment.
